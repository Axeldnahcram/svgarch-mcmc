# Presentation

This repository contains the material conceived for a final year project in Monte Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC) methods at ENSAE ParisTech.

The goal of the project was to implement a MCMC method from a previous research article.
Our goal was to:
- Implement a particle filter for the SV-Garch model introduced in the article
- Add the modification discussed in the second part to turn the log-likelihood continuous in the parameters
- Use this approach to maximize the likelihood on real data such as SP-500 assets time series.
